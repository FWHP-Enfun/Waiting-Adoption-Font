# 等管字體 Waiting Manage Font
為什麼叫等管字體？我自己亂取名字

Why is it called an equal tube font? I made up my own name

這裡是收爭議字體，算是別人個人製作的版權不明的字體孤兒院

This is a collection of controversial fonts, which can be regarded as an orphanage of fonts with unknown copyrights made by others

這裡字體在作者收養之前，別建議下載

Don't recommend downloading the font here before the author adopts it

為什麼想貼SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1文件，保護前作者，只要大改字體，算是可以商用

Why do you want to post the SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 file to protect the former author, as long as the font is changed, it can be regarded as commercial

有人用Flexifont做字體，就算是自己寫的，說是免費商用，Flexifont的規定，一般來說不能商用

Some people use Flexifont as a font, even if they write it themselves, they say it is free for commercial use, but the rules of Flexifont generally cannot be used for commercial use

我有看沐瑤手寫體，之前用Flexifont做字體，後來用FontCreator修改，變成可以商用

I have seen Muyao handwriting. I used Flexifont to make fonts before, and then modified them with FontCreator to become commercially available.

我打算用FontCreator修改Flexifont生成字體，去掉Flexifont信息，讓他們可以免費商用

I plan to use FontCreator to modify the fonts generated by Flexifont, remove the information of Flexifont, and make them free for commercial use

如果你是原作者，覺得我很糟，把你的字體隨便分享，覺得很生氣，我可以刪掉字體

If you are the original author, think I am bad, share your font casually, feel very angry, I can delete the font

你別生氣，你可以領養你做的字體

Don't be angry, you can adopt the font you made
